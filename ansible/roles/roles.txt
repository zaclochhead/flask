ansible roles make it easier to re-use playbooks for servers that 
may want to deploy the same service with different configurations. 
With the playbooks with tasks, all the tasks are executed specifically for 
the specified hosts. With roles, it lays out a foundation to deploy the service
and then can have specific configuration for different hosts. 
Ex - we have a mysql role for people that want to install mysql onto 
their hosts, rather than a database playbook to configure mysql specifically
for the database host.
